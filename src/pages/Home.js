          <h2>Welcome to my personal webpage!</h2>
          <h2>
            I'm Yuhi Chiba, a passionate student of Computer Science and Computer Engineering at Waseda University in Japan.
            Currently, I am an exchange student at the University of Texas at Austin.
          </h2>
          <h2>
            I am interested in computer science innovations, especially in the realm of artificial intelligence, and in how these advances can contribute to healthcare improvements.
            I also enjoy exploring back-end development and hardware engineering, appreciating the dynamic synergy between software and hardware systems.
          </h2>
          <h2>
            Throughout my university experience, I have built a solid foundation in computer science and engineering,
            acquiring practical programming skills in C, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and React through class projects and hands-on assignments.
            These experiences have improved my ability to develop efficient and reliable applications, both on the software and hardware sides.
          </h2>
          <h2>
            Besides technical expertise, I have gained a strong understanding of mathematics, physics, and chemistry,
            enabling me to tutor fellow students and help them excel in these subjects.
